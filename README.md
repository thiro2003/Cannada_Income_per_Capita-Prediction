# 📈 Predicting Canada’s Per Capita Income using Linear Regression  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project is my **first Machine Learning task** where I applied **Linear Regression** to predict **Canada’s per capita income** over the years. The goal was to build a simple regression model that can capture the trend and make predictions for future values.

## 🔹 Features  
- Data cleaning and preparation using **Pandas**  
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib**  
- Built a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn  
- Plotted regression line to show the relationship between year and per capita income  
- Predicted future income values based on the trained model

## 📊 Dataset  
- Dataset: *Canada per capita income by year*  
- Columns:  
  - `year` → year of record  
  - `per capita income` → income in Canadian dollars
